# Dark & Light Mode Website
 In this project, I have created a website that has a dark and light mode. I have used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website. I have used the `localStorage` to store the theme of the website. I have also used the `toggle` function to switch between the dark and light mode. It's not responsive yet, but I will make it responsive in the future.
